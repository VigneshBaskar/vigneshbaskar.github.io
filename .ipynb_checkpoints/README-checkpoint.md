# Welcome to Vignesh Baskaran's home page

## About me:
After graduating my Masters in Artificial Intelligence from KU Leuven, I started working as the first Data scientist of [Darts-IP](https://clarivate.com/darts-ip) in 2016. I started building the Machine learning team of my company and within three years we scaled up to seven Data scientists. I primarily focused on leading the Machine learning research and building state of the art NLP models. Owing to lack of good trademark image recognition systems in the market we spun off a separate business unit called [Darts-AI](https://darts.ai/). As the principal scientist of Darts-AI, I focused on developing state of the art image recognition systems. Within four months of launching the new business unit, my company got acquired and I moved to the parent company and then eventually within few months I left to build my own startup.

Here is the video where I along with my ex-boss (ex-Managing Director of Darts-IP) [Evrard Van Zuylen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evrard-van-zuylen-081132/) launch the early prototype of Darts-AI: [Video link](https://youtu.be/FQ_Y1xnscPg?t=4412). We compare our algorithm against the largest market leader of Trademark recognition system back then.

Here is a demo of some of the start of art NLP and Image recognition systems I developed at Darts-IP: [Video link](https://youtu.be/FQ_Y1xnscPg?t=4163)

Here is the entire stream for people who are interested in getting to know all the Machine learning systems I developed at Darts-IP: [Video link](https://youtu.be/FQ_Y1xnscPg?t=3262)
